    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Honey-glazed ham</strong> is perfect for holiday dinners or other special occasions. An easy, homemade glaze is brushed onto the ham during the last half hour of baking, adding incredible flavor and creating a sweet, sticky, caramelized coating your guests will love. I came up with the glaze for this ham using ingredients on hand and it's the best I've ever tasted.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Pineapple juice</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove ham from the oven after it has baked for 2 hours. Brush with glaze. Bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, brushing ham with glaze every 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
